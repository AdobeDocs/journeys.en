The conditional instruction (if, then, else) is supported in the advanced editor. It allows to define more complex expressions. It is composed of the following elements:

* **[!UICONTROL if]**: the condition to be evaluated first.
* **[!UICONTROL then]**: the expression to be evaluated in case the result of the condition evaluation is true.
* **[!UICONTROL else]**: the expression to be evaluated in case the result of the condition evaluation is false.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Parentheses are required around all the expressions.

   ```json
   if  (<expression1>)
   then
      (<expression2>)
   else
      (<expression3>)
   ```

`<expression1>` must return a **boolean**.

`<expression2>` and `<expression3>` must have the same type or compatible types. The supported signatures and returned types are:

   ```json
   boolean,boolean : boolean
   dateTime,dateTime : dateTime
   dateTimeOnly,dateTimeOnly : dateTimeOnly
   decimal,integer : decimal
   integer,decimal : integer
   integer,decimal : decimal
   duration,duration : duration
   string,string : string
   listBoolean,listBoolean : listBoolean
   listDateTime,listDateTime : listDateTime
   listDateTimeOnly,listDateTimeOnly : listDateTimeOnly
   listDateOnly,listDateOnly : listDateOnly
   listDecimal,listDecimal : listDecimal
   listInteger,listInteger : listInteger
   listString,listString : listString
   ```

**Usage**

The conditional instruction allows you to optimize the journey workflow by reducing the number of condition activities. For example, within the same action activity, you can specify two alternatives for a field definition using only one condition expression.

Example for an action activity (for a field that expects a string as the result of the conditional instruction):

   ```json
   if (startWithIgnoreCase(@{eventiOSPushPermissionAllowed.device.model}, 'iPad') or startWithIgnoreCase(@{eventiOSPushPermissionAllowed.device.model}, 'iOS'))
   then
      ('apns')
   else
      ('fcm')
   ```
