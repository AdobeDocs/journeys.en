# About Plaform segments {#about-segments}

If you're using the [Platform Segmentation Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/segmentation/home.html) to create your segments, you can leverage them in Journey Orchestration. This allows you to make individuals enter or move forward in a journey based on Platform segment entrances and exits. This also allows you to build complex conditions in your journeys using the simple or advanced expression editor.

Here are the possibilities Journey Orchestration offer you with segments:

* Access the list of Platform segments. See [](../segment/creating-a-segment.md).
* Create them directly in Journey Orchestration the same way you create them in the Segmentation Service. See [](../segment/creating-a-segment.md).
* Leverage segments in your journeys' conditions using the simple or advanced expression editor. See [](../segment/using-a-segment.md).
* Add a **Segment qualification** event to your journey in order to listen to the entrances and exits of profiles in Platform segments. See [](../building-journeys/event-activities.md#segment-qualification).
