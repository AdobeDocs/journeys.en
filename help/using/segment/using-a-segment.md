# Using segments in conditions {#using-a-segment}

This section explains how to use a segment in a journey condition. To learn how to use a **[!UICONTROL Segment qualification]** event in your journey, refer to [Events activities](../building-journeys/segment-qualification-events.md).

To use a segment in a journey condition, follow these steps:

1. Open a journey, drop a **[!UICONTROL Condition]** activity and choose the **Data Source Condition**.
