# Creating your Journeys reports{#concept_rfj_wpt_52b}

This section will present you how to create or use out-of-the-box reports. Combine panels, components and visualizations to better track the success of your journeys.

1. To create a custom report on your journeys, you first need to access the reports by clicking the **Reports** tab if you want to target every created journey. You can also access the reports to a specific journey from your journey's summary page.

1. Click the **Create new project** if you want to create your report from scratch.
