# About events activities {#concept_rws_1rt_52b}

The events configured by the technical user (see [](../event/about-events.md) are all displayed in the first category of the palette, on the left side of the screen.

Always start your journey by drag and dropping an event activity. You can also double-click on it.

When you click on the event activity in the canvas, the activity configuration pane is displayed. By default, when you use the same event several times, an incremented number is added to the event name in the canvas. In addition, you can use the **[!UICONTROL Label]** field to add a suffix to the event name that will appear under your activity in the canvas. This is useful to identify your events in the canvas, especially if you use the same event several times. It will also make debugging easier in case of errors and it will make reports easier to read.

## General events {#section_ofg_jss_dgb}

For this type of event, you can only add a label and a description. The rest of the configuration cannot be edited. It was performed by the technical user. See [](../event/about-events.md).
