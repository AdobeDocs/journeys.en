# Terminating a journey

The **Stop** and **Finish** options allow you to terminate journeys. Finishing a journey involves that the customers who already started in the journey are able to experience it to the end. Stopping a journey involves that journeys already started by users are immediately terminated.

## Finishing a journey

You can finish a journey manually to ensure that customers who already entered the journey can finish their path but new users are not able to enter the journey.

A finished journey version cannot be restarted. You can create a new version from the journey or duplicate it.

>[!WARNING]
>
>When a version of a journey is manually finished, any new entrance on events for new customer is forbidden.

You can stop a journey by clicking **Finish** while hovering over a journey in the list of journeys.
