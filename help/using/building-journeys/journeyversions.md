# Journey versions{#concept_ldc_k55_zgb}

In the journey list, all journey versions are displayed with the version number. See [The journey designer's interface](../building-journeys/journeyinterface.md#concept_m1g_5qt_52b). When you search for a journey, newest versions appear first.

If you need to modify to a live journey, you need to create a new version of your journey.

1. Open the latest version of your live journey, click **Create a new version** and confirm.

	>[!NOTE]
	>
	>You can only create a new version from the latest version of a journey.

1. Make your modifications, click **Publish** and confirm.

At publication time, individuals will start to flow into the latest version of the journey. People who have already entered a previous version stay in it until they finish the journey. If they later re-enter the same journey, they will go into the latest version.

Journey versions can be stopped individually. All versions of journeys have the same name.

>[!NOTE]

>If you have several live versions and you stop the latest one, people will not fall back to a previous live version.
