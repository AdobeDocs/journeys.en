# Journey versions{#concept_ldc_k55_zgb}

In the journey list, all journey versions are displayed with the version number. See [](../building-journeys/journey-interface.md). When you search for a journey, newest versions appear at the top of the list the first time the application opens. Then, you can define the sorting you want and the application will keep it as a user preference. The journey's version is also displayed at the top of the journey edition interface, above the canvas.

If you need to modify to a live journey, you need to create a new version of your journey.

1. Open the latest version of your live journey, click **Create a new version** and confirm.

    >You can only create a new version from the latest version of a journey.

1. Make your modifications, click **Publish** and confirm.

From the moment the journey is published, individuals will start to flow into the latest version of the journey. People who have already entered a previous version stay in it until they finish the journey. If they later re-enter the same journey, they will go into the latest version.

Journey versions can be stopped individually. All versions of journeys have the same name.

>If you have several live versions and you stop the latest one, people will not fall back to a previous live version. No entrance in the journey will happen.
