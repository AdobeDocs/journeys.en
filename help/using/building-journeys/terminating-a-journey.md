The **[!UICONTROL Stop]** and **[!UICONTROL Close to new entrances]** options allow you to terminate **live** journeys. Closing a journey involves **that the arrival of new customers in the journey is blocked** and that the customers who already entered in the journey are able to experience it to the end. This is the most recommended way to put an end to a journey as it offers the best experience for customers. Stopping a journey involves that people who already entered a journey are all stopped in their progress. The journey is basically switched off.

>Note that you cannot resume a closed or stopped journey.

## Closing a journey

You can close a journey manually to ensure that customers who already entered the journey can finish their path but new users are not able to enter the journey.

When closed, a journey will have the status **[!UICONTROL Closed (no entrance)]**. After the default global timeout of 30 days, the journey will switch to the **Finished** status. See this [section](../building-journeys/changing-properties.md#entrance).

A closed journey version cannot be restarted or deleted. You can create a new version of it or duplicate it. Only finished journeys can be deleted.

You can close a journey by clicking **[!UICONTROL Close to new entrances]** while hovering over a journey in the list of journeys.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Close to new entrances]**. A dialog box appears.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Close to new entrances]** to confirm.

## Stopping a journey

You can stop a journey when an emergency occurred and all processing needs to be ended immediately on a journey.

A stopped journey version cannot be restarted.

When stopped, a journey will have the status **[!UICONTROL Stopped]**. 

You can stop a journey (for example if a marketer realizes that the journey targets the wrong audience or a custom action supposed to deliver messages is not working correctlyâ€¦) by clicking **[!UICONTROL Stop]** while hovering over a journey in the list of journeys.
