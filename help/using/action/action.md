# About actions {#about_actions}

The configuration of custom actions is always performed by a **technical user**.

This is where you define the connection to the system that will send messages. The actions defined here will then be available in the left palette of your journey, in the **Action** category (see [Action activities](../building-journeys/journeyaction.md#concept_hbj_hrt_52b)).

To view the action list or configure a new action, click **Actions** in the top menus. The list of actions is displayed. See [User interface](../about/aboutinterface.md#concept_rcq_lqt_52b) for more information on the interface.

If you have Adobe Campaign Standard, you need to configure the out-of-the box action. Refer to [Working with Adobe Campaign Standard](../action/actioncampaign.md).

If you're using a third-party system to send messages, you need to add and configure a custom action. Refer to [Using a third-party system](../action/custom.md).
