# Configuring an action {#concept_sxy_bzs_dgb}

This is where you define the connection to the system that will send messages. The actions defined here will then be available in the left palette of your journey, in the **Action** category (see [Action activities](../building-journeys/journeyaction.md#concept_hbj_hrt_52b)).

If you have Adobe Campaign Standard, you don't have to do anything, the connection is pre-configured. Refer to [Using Adobe Campaign Standard](../custom-action/actioncampaign.md).

If you're using a third-party system to send messages, you need to add and configure a custom action. Refer to [Using a third-party system](../custom-action/customabout.md).
