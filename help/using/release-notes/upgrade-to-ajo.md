# Upgrade your Journey Orchestration environment to Adobe Journey Optimizer{#ugrade-ajo}

## What is Adobe Journey Optimizer?

Adobe Journey Optimizer is an agile and scalable application built natively on the Adobe Experience Platform for orchestrating and delivering personalized, connected, and timely customer journeys across any app, device, screen, or channel.â€‹

## What is Journey Orchestration?

Journey Orchestration is a service built on Adobe Experience Platform that allows you tailor individual journeys for each customer based on their previous behavior and preferences. Journey Orchestration is the precursor application to Journey Optimizer. 

## Why should I move to Adobe Journey Optimizer?

**Access to a streamlined interface** with Experience Platform capabilities giving quick access to journeys, datasets, profiles, alerting and more. No need to do back and forth between Adobe Experience Platform and Journey Orchestration anymore to access schemas or datasets, everything is directly available from Adobe Journey Optimizer. For more information, refer to this [page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/user-interface.html).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to plan anything to move from Journey Orchestration to Adobe Journey Optimizer?

### I still see Journey Orchestration in the application switcher, is it normal?

![](../assets/migration-ajo-9.png)

Yes, it is normal. You will keep the access to Journey Orchestration for one month following the upgrade. This will give you enough time to update all your users permissions and get more familiar with Adobe Journey Optimizer. After one month, the access will be removed.

### What happens if I use Journey Orchestration with Adobe Campaign Standard today?

By moving to Adobe Journey Optimizer, you will still be able to use the integration between Journeys and Adobe Campaign Standard by designing your customer journey in Adobe Journey Optimizer and letting Adobe Campaign Standard send the delivery.

However, due to how Adobe Journey Optimizer reporting stack works, reporting will not combine Journey and Campaign Standard data. Journey information will be available in Adobe Journey Optimizer reports and delivery information in Adobe Campaign Standard. A configuration of Experience Platform can be made to bring back Adobe Campaign Standard data into Adobe Experience Platform, making it  available to Customer Journey Analytics ([learn more](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-platform/customer-journey-analytics.html)) or other third party reporting tools such as Tableau or PowerBI.

Adobe Journey Optimizer reports best operate when using Adobe Journey Optimizer's out-of-the-box messaging capabilities (available in dedicated Adobe Journey Optimizer offerings). For more information on how Messages can be authored in the journey canvas, refer to this [page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/messages/messages-in-journeys.html).
