# Release Notes {#release-notes}

This page lists all the new features and improvements for Journey Orchestration.
You can also consult the [Documentation Updates](../release-notes/documentation-updates.md).

## November 2020 Release {#november-release}

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Jumping from one journey to another</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>We've added a new action activity which allows you to push individuals from one journey to another. The Jump activity allows you to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simplify the design of very complex journeys by splitting them into several ones </li>
<li>build journeys based on common and reusable journey patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../building-journeys/jump.md">detailed documentation</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Using journey properties in the expression editor</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>In the advanced expression editor, we've added a new category in the list of fields and functions. This is the information retrieved by the system from live journeys, such as the journey ID or the specific errors encountered. This will give you more possibilities when building your conditions. For example, you will be able to filter individuals discarded by a capping rule and push them to a third-party system to log them.
</p>
<p>Note that this feature will be available in the coming days.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../expression/journey-properties.md">detailed documentation</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Rule based events (beta)</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>We've added a new method to set up your events more easily. This feature, which has been tested among a limited set of customers through the Alpha program, is now available in Beta to all customers. This new method does not require the use of an eventID. It evaluates if the event should be triggered according to a conditon. You can still use the existing method, now called "system-generated".
</p>
<p>Note that this feature will be available in the coming days.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../expression/journey-properties.md">detailed documentation</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Other improvements{#october-november}

Limitations have been added when creating new versions of a journey. These limitations optimize the use of new versions and facilitate reporting. [Read more](../about/limitations.md#journey-versions-limitations)

The **Segment Qualification** activity can no longer be used in a journey that includes Campaign Standard message activities. This restriction prevents the risk of peaks of events flowing in segment qualification based journeys due to the limited scale of Campaign transactional messaging. [Read more](../about/limitations.md#segment-qualification)

## October 2020 Release {#october-release}

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Event timeout</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You can now configure a timeout for an event in order to make a journey listen to an event only during a certain time. You no longer need to add a Wait activity in parallel to the event path to achieve this.
</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../building-journeys/event-activities.md#listening-to-events-during-a-specific-time">detailed documentation</a>.</p>

**Other improvements**

To avoid sending too many API calls to third-party systems, we're introducing a new public API to setup "capping" rules. Capping rules allow the definition of a maximum number of calls to an API endpoint per milliseconds. [Read more](../api/capping.md)

Access control now allows more granularity in user access management. Effective availability: June, 30 2020. [Read more](../about/access-management.md#create-product-profile)

**Other improvements**

* In addition to US, Journey Orchestration is now available in **EMEA**. The application and documentation are available in French and German.

Direct access to Journey Orchestration documentation is available at the bottom of the Help tab. Additionally, click Help > Feedback to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.

* The **C** keyboard shortcut, which allows you to create a new item, is now available in all list screens: journeys, data sources, actions and events. [Read more](../about/user-interface.md#section_ksq_zr1_ffb)

* You can now **delete** stopped journeys. Reports associated to these deleted journeys will not be available.

* When browsing through **Adobe Experience Platform fields** (XDM format), you will now see the display name in addition to the field name. This information is retrieved from the schema definition in the Experience Data Model. When available, the alternate display name appears. This user-friendly description, especially useful in the case of eVar fields, allows you identify your fields more easily. [Read more](../about/user-interface.md#friendly-names-display)

## GA Release - December 2019 {#ga-release---december-2019}

Journey Orchestration is now GA. 

Build real-time orchestration use cases leveraging contextual data stored in events or data sources.

Journey Orchestration allows real-time orchestration powered by contextual data from events, information from the Adobe Experience Platform, or data from third-party API services. The application determines in multistep flows called journeys the next best actions specific to the consumer, based on their profile and behaviors. This comprises both the optimal timing, as well as the type of action, such as sending the consumer a push notification via Adobe Campaign Standard transactional messaging capabilities (requires Adobe Campaign Standard) or the notification of a third-party system. These decisions are made based on rules and Sensei scores.
