This use case will show you how to leverage fatigue scores to avoid over-soliciting your customers in your journeys.

## Building the journey {#section_uzm_pyy_wfb}

To create, validate and publish the journey, follow the steps described in [this page](../building-journeys/journey.md).

In our use case, we're leveraging the **[!UICONTROL fatigueLevel]** field. You can also use the **[!UICONTROL fatigueScore]** field.

Perform the following steps to leverage the fatigue level in your journey:

1. Add an event and a condition in your journey.

1. Choose the **[!UICONTROL Data Source Condition]** type and click in the **[!UICONTROL Expression]** field.

1. Using the simple expression editor, look for the **[!UICONTROL fatigueLevel]** field (_ExperiencePlatformDataSource > JourneyAIScores > Profile > journeyAI > emailScore > fatigue_), drop it to the right and create the following condition: "fatigueLevel is equal to "Low". Click **[!UICONTROL Ok]**.

    ![](../assets/journeyuc3_3.png)

    The advanced expression is: 

    ```
    #{ExperiencePlatformDataSource.JourneyAIScores.Profile.journeyAI.emailScore.fatigue.fatigueLevel} == "low"
    ```

1. In the condition, create two other paths for medium and high fatigue levels.
