# Simple use case pre-requisites {#concept_zkd_yby_w2b}

For our use case, we have designed one email transactional messaging template in Adobe Campaign Standard. We are using an event transactional messaging template. Refer to this [page](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/communication-channels/transactional-messaging/about-transactional-messaging.html).

Adobe Campaign Standard is configured to send emails.

Events are sent from the customers' mobile phone when they are detected near a beacon. You need to design a mobile application to send events from the customer's mobile phone to the Mobile SDK.
