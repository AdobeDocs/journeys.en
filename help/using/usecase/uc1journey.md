# Building the journey {#concept_eyw_mcy_w2b}

The **business user** can now build the journey. Our journey will only include one path with the following activities:

* the "SpaBeacon" **event**: when a person walks near the spa beacon, the system will receive an event and the journey will start for that person.
* a **Condition** activity to check that the person is a woman
* an **Email** activity (using Adobe Campaign Standard)
* an **End** activity

>[!NOTE]
>
>The **Push** and **Email** activities are only available in the palette if you have Adobe Campaign Standard.

For additional information on how to build a journey, refer to [Building a journey](../building-journeys/journey.md#concept_gq5_sqt_52b).

1. In the top menu, click the **Home** tab and **Create** to create a new journey.

1. Edit the journey's properties in the configuration pane displayed on the right side. We name it "Spa journey" and set it to last for one month, from the 1st to the 31st of December.

1. Drop an **Email** activity and select your "Spa discount" transactional messaging template. This template was designed using Adobe Campaign. Refer to this [page](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/communication-channels/transactional-messaging/about-transactional-messaging.html).

1. Drop an **End** activity.

1. Click on the **Test** toggle and test your journey using test profiles. If there is any error, deactivate the test mode, modify your journey and test it again. For more information on the test mode, refer to [Testing your journey](../building-journeys/journeypublication.md#section_ctr_lqk_fhb). 

    ![](../assets/journeyuc1_18bis.png)

1. When the test is conclusive, you can publish your journey from the top right drop-down menu.

Next time a woman walks near the spa beacon, she will immediately receive a "Spa discount" personalized email.
