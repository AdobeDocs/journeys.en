## About the Alpha version interface {#about-alpha-interface}

Navigation within [!DNL Journey Orchestration] menus has been enhanced, in order to provide a consistant interface with Adobe Experience Platform. Changes include:

* Menus moved from the top to the left-hand side of the interface,
* Grouping of admin functionalities into a single dashboard.

Global concepts on how to use and navigate in the interface (searching and filtering, browsing through Adobe Experience Platform fields, shortcuts) are presented in [this section](../about/user-interface.md).

## Accessing [!DNL Journey Orchestration] functionalities {#accessing-journey-orchestration-functionalities}

The menu bar located on the left-hand side give you access to the different functionalities. Click on an icon to access the corresponding menu. You can click the arrow at the bottom left to expand or collapse the menu bar.
