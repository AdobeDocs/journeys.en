# Ending a journey{#concept_y4b_4qt_52b}

There are three ways to end a journey:

* The person arrives at an **End** activity.
* The person arrives at the last activity of a path.
* The person arrives at a condition activity (or a wait activity with a condition) and does not match any of the conditions.

The person can then re-enter the journey if re-entrance is allowed. See [](../building-journeys/journeyproperty.md#concept_prq_wqt_52b).
