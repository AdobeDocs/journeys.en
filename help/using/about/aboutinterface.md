## Searching and filtering{#section_lgm_hpz_pgb}

In the **Journeys**, **Data Sources**, **Events** and **Actions** lists, a search bar allows you to search for an item. Use the left drop-down menu to search in names, descriptions or both. Use the **Filters** drop-down menu to filter the elements according to different criteria. You can choose to only display the elements of a certain type or status, the ones you created, or the ones modified in the last 30 days.

In the **Journeys** list, a drop-down menu allows you to only display the journeys that use a particular event, field group or action. See [The journey designer's interface](../building-journeys/journeyinterface.md#concept_m1g_5qt_52b).

In the event, data source and action configuration panes, the **Used in** field displays the number of journeys that use that particular event, field group or action. You can click the **View journeys** button to display the list of corresponding journeys.
