## Searching and filtering{#section_lgm_hpz_pgb}

In the **Home**, **Data Sources**, **Events** and **Actions** lists, a search bar allows you to search for an item. Use the left drop-down menu to search in names, descriptions or both. Use the **Filters** drop-down menu to filter the elements according to different criteria. You can choose to only display the elements of a certain type or status, the ones you created, or the ones modified in the last 30 days.

In the **Home** menu, the list of journeys is displayed. A drop-down menu allows you to only display the journeys that use a particular event, field group or action. See [The journey designer's interface](../building-journeys/journeyinterface.md#concept_m1g_5qt_52b).

>[!NOTE]

>Note that columns displayed can be personalized using the configuration button on the top right of the lists. Personalization is saved for each user.
