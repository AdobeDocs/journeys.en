## About access management {#about-access-management}

[!DNL Journey Orchestration] allows you to assign a set of permissions to your users to define which part of the interface they can access.

They can be managed by Administrators that have access to the Admin Console. For more information on the Admin Console, refer to the [Enterprise and teams admin guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/managing/user-guide.html).

To be able to access [!DNL Journey Orchestration], a user must be:

* part of a [!DNL Journey Orchestration] **[!UICONTROL product profile]** associated to [!DNL Journey Orchestration] permissions.
* part of an [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] **[!UICONTROL product profile]**. There is no mandatory permission to have. The user should have the **[!UICONTROL profile management]** permission to be able to create and edit platform segments from [!DNL Journey Orchestration] interface. For more on this, refer to this [page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/access-control/home.html#adobe-admin-console).

In Admin Console, you can assign one of the following out-of-the-box product profiles to your users:

*   **[!UICONTROL Limited Access User]**: user with read-only access to journeys and reports. This product profile includes the following permissions:
    *   Read journeys
    *   Read reports

*   **[!UICONTROL Administrators]**: user with access to the administration menus with the possibility to manage journeys, events and reports. This product profile includes the following permissions:
    *   Manage journeys
    *   Publish journeys
    *   Manage events, data sources and actions
    *   Manage reports

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >**[!UICONTROL Administrators]** is the only product profile which allows creation, edition and publication of transactional messaging (or messaging templates) in Adobe Campaign Standard. This product profile is needed if you use Adobe Campaign Standard to send messages in your journeys. It should not be renamed in Admin Console.

*   **[!UICONTROL Standard User]**: user with basic access such as journey management. This product profile includes the following permissions:
    *   Manage journeys
    *   Publish journeys
    *   Manage reports
    *   Read Events, data sources and actions

You can also create your own product profiles if the out-of-the-box profiles are not enough to manage your users.
Users must always be linked to a product profile allowing you to assign them specific build-in permissions such as:

*   **[!UICONTROL Read journeys]**
*   **[!UICONTROL Read reports]**
*   **[!UICONTROL Manage events, data sources and actions]**
*   **[!UICONTROL Read events, data sources and actions]**
*   **[!UICONTROL Manage journeys]**
*   **[!UICONTROL Publish journeys]**
*   **[!UICONTROL Manage reports]**

You can find below the compatibility between permissions and [!DNL Journey Orchestration]'s different functionalities.
